            These Service Providers will be required to only process Data in

            confidentiality of the Data they process by implementing appropriate
            technical and organizational security measures and confidentiality
            obligations binding employees accessing Data.

            disclosure is necessary to protect individuals’ vital interests, or
            in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual
            fraudulent or illegal activity. This may include exchanging
            information with other companies and organizations for fraud
            protection, risk management and dispute resolution. This does not
            include selling or otherwise disclosing personal information of
            users for commercial purposes in violation of this Privacy Notice.
