          1.1 We partner with third-party logistic service providers ("Logistic
          Partners") in order to effectuate Product shipping and delivery to
          you. We shall provide the details of the Logistic Partners which will
          be responsible for processing the shipping and delivery of any
          Product(s) purchased by you on the Platform at the time such Product
          is processed and successfully handed over to the Logistic artner by
          us. Our standard dispatch timelines range between 24 (twenty-four)
          hours from the time the Product Order has been placed by you on the
          Platform. In any case, the user will be provided with an estimated
          timeline for the delivery of the Product purchased from the Platform.
          This estimated timeline shall be notified to the user on the order
          confirmation page displayed at the time the order is confirmed by us.
          We will also share details about your orders pursuant to their
          dispatch on the e-mail ID and/or mobile number provided by
          you/registered with us. You agree and understand that though we
          effectuate Product delivery to the Users through our Logistic
          Partners, we reserve the right to ship and deliver the Products on our
          own without engaging any Logistic Partners or third-party service
          providers.

          1.3 You agree and understand that though we endeavor to ship and
          deliver our Products all across India, we may, in our sole discretion
          determine a select list of areas that are unserviceable for delivery
          of Products. We, or our Logistic Partners, do not provide shipping and
          delivery services in such unserviceable areas and may not process your
          orders on the Platform in such cases. In the event, an area has been
          deemed unserviceable by us, we shall notify such user at the time of
          placing an order for the purchase of Products on the Platform. You may
          also verify whether an area is unserviceable for deliveries by us by
          entering the relevant area pin-code on the Platform.

          1.4 You agree and acknowledge that to effectuate the timely delivery
          of the purchased Products to you we may inquire or collect specific
          information like your name, shipping address, billing address,
          landmarks, contact details, etc. You shall ensure that all information
          that is submitted by you to us on the Platform is true, complete,
          accurate, and sufficient to identify the actual place of delivery. You
          understand that you shall bear absolute liability in case of any
          failure by us in delivering the purchased Products due to your failure
          to provide correct, complete, sufficient, and accurate information at
          the time of placing the order. It is further clarified that we shall
          not be liable in any manner and at any point in time due to your
          failure to provide correct and complete information.

          1.5 We will attempt to deliver the purchased Product to your
          designated address within the estimated timeline of delivery notified
          to you. In the event you are not available or present to accept the
          delivery of the Product, our Logistic Partners will make a maximum of
          three attempts in 3 (three) days (each attempt every day) to deliver
          the purchased Product(s) to you. If the third delivery attempt is
          unsuccessful and you continue to remain unavailable, we reserve the
          right to cancel the order of the purchased Products at our sole
          discretion and process the return of such Product to us. We further
          reserve the right to deduct the shipping and delivery charges borne by
          us while processing any refunds subsequent to such cancellation.

          1.6 While we make reasonable endeavors in ensuring that purchased
          Products are delivered to you in a timely manner and within the
          timeline notified to you, you accept and acknowledge that the delivery
          may be delayed on account of:

          <li>(a) Logistical issues beyond our control;</li>

          In such events of delay, we shall make a reasonable attempt to inform
          you by writing to your email ID and/or mobile number registered with
          us. We disclaim all liabilities that may arise on account of our
          failure to inform or notify you of delays in the delivery of purchased
          Products on the Platform. Further, we shall be under no obligation to
          compensate you for any claim that may otherwise arise on account of
          delay in the shipment or delivery or use of the purchased Products.
        </p>
        <p className='text-gray-700'>
          1.7 We endeavor to engage Logistic Partners, employees, and agents
          with the highest regard for ethics and integrity; and behave in a
          fashion that exudes thorough professionalism, competence, and good
          mannerism. You agree and acknowledge that the actions, and inactions
          of delivery individuals are not in our control, and it is not possible
          for us to monitor and observe each delivery executive. Since we are
          merely facilitating delivery of a Product purchased by you, we shall
          not be liable for any acts or omissions on part of our delivery
          agents, employees, or personnel and/or the Logistic Partner or their
          employees, agents, or personnel including deficiency in service, wrong
          delivery of Product, time taken to deliver the Product, Product
          package tampering, etc. For the sake of abundant clarity, it is stated
          that any ill-mannerism, impoliteness, discourtesy, or offensiveness
          shown by our delivery executives or the employees, agents, or
          personnel of the Logistic Partners is beyond our control and any issue
          arising between you and our delivery executive or an employee, agent,
          or personnel of the Logistic Partner will have to be resolved by you
          independently. You agree and acknowledge that you will not hold us
          responsible or require us to settle, mediate or resolve any disputes
          between you and the delivery personnel delivering the Products to you.

          1.8 Once you place an order on the Platform, we process such order and
          hand over the purchased Product to our Logistic Partner. The User will
          receive a unique tracking identity number once the purchased Product
          is handed over to the Logistics Partner, which will enable the User in
          tracking the status of delivery of the purchased Products. The User
          may use the tracking identity number on the Platform or the website
          and/or the mobile application of the Logistic Partner to check the
          status and location of the purchased Product and its estimated time of
          delivery. Our customer service team coordinates with the Logistic
          Partners to ensure that the Products are delivered to you at the
          earliest and make all reasonable efforts in ensuring that the Logistic
          Partners update the tracking status of the purchased Products on a
          real-time basis. It is clarified that we engage third-party service
          providers to effectuate deliveries of the Products and hence, we do
          not guarantee the accuracy or correctness of the tracking status and
          the status may be subject to inconsistencies arising out of time-lags
          in updating the information and/or other technical difficulties which
          are not in our control.
        </p>
        <p className='text-gray-700'>
          1.9 We reserve the right to charge or collect shipping fees on
          Products from time to time. Shipping charges may vary based on the
          value of the Product, type of Product, area of delivery, payment
          mechanism, etc. You agree that, we are authorized to collect, on
          behalf of the Logistic Partner, the shipping and delivery fees for the
          delivery service provided by the Logistic Partner. In the event we
          charge a shipping fee for the delivery of a purchased Product, such
          shipping fees will not be refunded by us pursuant to any return
          request raised by you. However, we may make exceptions and refund the
          shipping fees in the event a defective, damaged, deficient, or
          incorrect Product (for reasons attributable to, and accepted by us
          after due verification in our sole discretion) has been delivered. You
          acknowledge and accept that the title and risk of all Products ordered
          by you shall pass on to you upon the delivery of the purchased
          Products to you.
        </p>
        <p className='text-gray-700'>
          1.10 Return of purchased Products is facilitated through our
          reverse-Logistics Partners. On receipt of a request for the return of
          Product on the Platform and the same being duly acknowledged by us,
          our reverse-Logistics Partners shall get in touch with you in order to
          collect the purchased Products from you. We process returns and
          exchanges of purchased Products in accordance with our Cancellation,
          Return, and Refund Policy.
